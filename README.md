# GraphClass

GraphClass is a C++ application that rigorously and thoroughly tests an undirected, weighted graph. The graph is constructed as an adjacency list and includes multiple methods for traversing the graph.

## What I Learned

- Utilizing the vector container in the STL library to represent the graph's nodes
- Implementing a LinkedList class to represent the graph's edges 
- Enhancing problem solving skills when constructing algorithms for each of the traversals
- Separating interface from implementation
- Exhaustively testing a self constructed data type by validating and iterating through all of the GraphClass methods

## How It Works

- After running the application, the Graph class methods are tested and validated

- The undirected graph, which includes it's nodes, edges and their corresponding weights, is displayed as an adjacency list
